		My name is Nuradzrisya Khalida binti Mohd Khalid. I was born on 4th January 1999, Selangor. I am the second daughter of 3 siblings.
		I am a fresh graduate of Diploma in Office Management and Technology from Uitm Jengka Pahang. During diploma year I have mastered 
		the typing and microsoft skills. While waiting to further my degree, I have also mastered in baking and cooking. I lllooovvveeee
		to cook! and I llllllllloooooovvvvvvveeee to eat too! hihi. I eat all types of food, western and "masakan kampung". I like to 
		cook spicy food like "ayam masak hijau", "ayam masak merah" ummm everything that comes with "sambal" hihi. When my mother cook for
		lunch or dinner, I always watch and learn like how she prepare the foods. Aaaaaaannnnnnddddd when she's not around, she always ask 
		me to cook any dishes that I know. Good or bad taste everyone must taste it :p I always watch cooking show on youtube. "Dapur bujang" 
		is my favorite youtube channel! because the ingredient is so eeeeessssssaaaaayyyyyyeeeehhhhh hihi I like to bake too! 
		on weekend, when my aunty's have a lot of orders from customers, I went to her house to help her made any tradition "kuih', brownies, 
		sandwiches and more! My sister also bake cakes, brownies and cream puff. but I am soOooOOooo lazy to clean up all the mess! Now I owned 
		an online business called "thebakeriology" on instagram. Handling this business have thought me how to deal with customers, manage time 
		to complete the order on time, design and decorating cakes. </p>
